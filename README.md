# Spotify Podcast Automation App

Welcome to our Podcast Automation App! We hope this application makes it easier for you to stay up-to-date on all your favorite podcasts using Spotify.

## Application Overview

We built this application becasue Spotify does not always keep their listeners in the loop on their favorite podcasts. Spotify does not currently have a native way to notify users when the podcasts they follow add new episodes, leaving it up to their users to manually check every day ot see if an episode was added.

This application automatically updates a playlist in your Spotify library with the latest episodes from the podcasts you have followed. It then sends you a daily email with a summary of what has been added, so you can easily keep up with your favorite shows in an organized and hands-free way.

## Application Setup

                {{#each episode_info}}
	                {{this.show}}: {{this.name}}
                {{/each}}

## Deploy To Heroku Server Setup
* Step 5: Deploy on Heroku Directions Repurposed From: Prof Rossetti @ https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/exercises/web-service/deploying.md
  

    * If you haven't yet done so, [install the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#set-up), and make sure you can login and list your applications.
```sh
heroku login # just a one-time thing when you use heroku for the first time

heroku apps # at this time, results might be empty-ish
```

    * IMPORTANT: run the following commands from the root directory of your repository!
    * Use the online Heroku Dashboard or the command-line (instructions below) to create a new application server, specifying a unique name (e.g. "notification-app-123", but yours will need to be different):
    * Follow Heroku setup guide to get the application deployed on a server
    * Add a Heroku Scheduler addon to the server and set it to run `python -m web_app/email_update.py` once a day
    * Set your config variables
        * heroku config:set SENDGRID_API_KEY
        * heroku config:set SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID
        * heroku config:set MY_EMAIL
        * heroku config:set TO_EMAIL
